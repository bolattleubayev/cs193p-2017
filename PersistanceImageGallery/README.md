# PersistanceImageGallery

This is an implementation of in-class example of Image Gallery from Stanford CS193p Fall 2017-18 on iTunes U by Paul Hegarty. The project was adapted for Xcode 9 and Swift 4

This is a Document Based app which extends the functionality of AssignmentImageGallery app. You can check it out to understand what the app does.

The key difference is that in this app you can create documents that can be accessed by Documents app. This adds persistence to your app as well as an option to edit, share, and view documents. Also, a thumbnail of the gallery appears as icon.

### Adding new images

Adding new images is pretty much the same as in AssignmentImageGallery

<img src="/PersistanceImageGallery/images/0.png" width="600" height="450">
<img src="/PersistanceImageGallery/images/1.png" width="600" height="450">

### Document view
