# EmojiArtOLD

This is an implementation of in-class example of EmojiArt from Stanford CS193p Fall 2017-18 on iTunes U by Paul Hegarty. The project was adapted for Xcode 9 and Swift 4

The idea of the app is to create arts using images from the web that contain both URL and image and on top of them add custom emojis.

### Adding images from Safari

To add image as a background it must have URL and image, so you need to drag image from another app and drop it in the Drop Zone.

<img src="/images/0.png" width="600" height="450">

The result after dropping is

<img src="/images/1.png" width="600" height="450">

### Adding emojis

You can add emojis from the Scroll View to the image that was dropped from Safari

<img src="/images/2.png" width="600" height="450">

### Customising the emoji Scroll View

You can also add your own characters to the emojis Scroll View by clicking "+"

<img src="/images/3.png" width="600" height="450">
<img src="/images/4.png" width="600" height="450">
<img src="/images/5.png" width="600" height="450">
